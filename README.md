# ROck Shadow COunter (ROSCO)

ROSCO is a codebase originally developed at NASA/JPL to detect rocks in aerial imagery by by looking for their shadows.

This repository brings several existing sources into a linear history and is the currently active branch of the shadow-based rock detection code from 2006 to present.  The sources included:

* code recovered from the original authors, Andres Huertas and Yang Cheng, used for the Mars Phoenix Lander mission
* code handed off by Andres at his retirement (used for the MSL and InSight missions)
* code used for the Mars 2020 mission.
